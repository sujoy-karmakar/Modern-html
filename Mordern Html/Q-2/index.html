    <!-- What are HTML Entities -->
    HTML entities are special codes or sequences used in HTML documents to represent characters that have special meanings or cannot be easily included in the document using the characters themselves. HTML entities are typically written using the & (ampersand) symbol followed by a specific code or name, and they end with a ; (semicolon). They are used to display reserved characters, special symbols, and characters that might conflict with HTML syntax.
